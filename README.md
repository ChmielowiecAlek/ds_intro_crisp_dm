#Introduction

The purpose of this project is to practice the [CRISP-DM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-industry_standard_process_for_data_mining) process.

##The Source of the Topic and Data

I've been looking for a sample dataset for some time and found an interesting one in the [FiveThirtyEight](https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/data/tree/master/masculinity-survey) repository. There's an accompanying (original) story [What Do Men Think It Means To Be A Man?](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/what-do-men-think-it-means-to-be-a-man/).

I've found the topic interesting, and the original results could serve as a benchmark for assessing my work.
